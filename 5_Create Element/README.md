In Type1 file whenever data is entered in a form of space it represent in sample data. 

But in Type2 trim method is used which help to ignore this space. If space is given in place of text it will provide alert message.

Also in Type2 toUpperCase() method is used which help to convert lowercase to uppercase. For example --> 'yosita' is entered it will convert it into uppercase in form of 'YOSHITA'.

Similarly vice-versa happens with lowercase.
