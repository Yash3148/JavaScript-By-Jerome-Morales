# In Type1 file whenever data is entered in a form of space it represent in sample data. 
# But in Type2 trim method is used which help to ignore this space. If space is given in place of text it will provide alert message.
# Also in Type2 toUpperCase() method is used which help to convert lowercase to uppercase. For example --> 'yosita' is entered it will convert it into uppercase in form of 'YOSHITA'
# Similarly vice-versa happens with lowercase.
